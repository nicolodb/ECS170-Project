# description
this is just a bunch of graphs!
k_mean_song: used to find the most optimal number of clusters  
  -> k=[number]_song: experimenting with different number of clusters  
    -> [number] = the number of clusters  
  -> the most optimal would be either 5 or 6 clusters  

k_mean_genre: used to find the most optimal number of clusters   
  ->k=[number]_genre: experimenting with different number of clusters  
    -> [number] = the number of clusters  
  -> the most optimal would be probably 8
